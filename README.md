# cluster2celltype

Using biological priors (previously selected important features or "markers") to assign cell types to clusters based on differential discriminability of each cluster based on dictionary of cell type to selected features (cell type markers)

Can be thought of as semi-manual annotation of single-cell data

Classifier is simple (for speed): LR w/L1 regularization
